Path to Gromacs: 

~/progs/gmx_465-bin/bin/* 

* = comando

Es, per il trjconv: 

~/progs/gmx_465-bin/bin/trjconv_mpi -f rmd-gb.trr -s rmd-gb.tpr -o md-gb.pdb

Simone: I added a ./bash_profile (you can't see it using ls since it's hidden) exporting the gromacs path. For future knowledge, just do the following:
vim ./bash_profile #create the file
export PATH="the/path/you/want" #enables the path inside the directory
Now we can use every gromacs command within implicit/.
